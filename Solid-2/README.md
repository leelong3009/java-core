# S.O.L.I.D

1. Single Responsitory Principle
⋅⋅* A class should have only one reason to change.
2. Open/Close Principle
- Software entities like classes, modules and functions should be open for extension but closed for modifications.
3. Liskov's subtitution Principle
- We must make sure that the new derived classes just extend without replacing the functionality of old classes. Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types.
4. Interface segregation Principle
- Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don't use.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. 
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
